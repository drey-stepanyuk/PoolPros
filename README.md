# PoolPros

This project has been a great experience and opportunity. I still have a ton of stuff I want/need to improve but I enjoyed working with strictly vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I have become comfortable with jQuery/bootstrp and jumping back to vanilla was quite a challenge but refreshing and much needed. The project features/to-dos can be found below:

## Features

* Responsive design utilizing flexbox heavily.
* JavaScript for interactivity
* Responsive modals and menus
* Divs populated from data in a JSON file.
* Dynamic icons inside of JSON populated divs. 

## TO-DO

- [X] Modals won't open unless function uses single ID, find a way to use classes from the JSON data.
- [ ] Update top strip with terms
- [ ] Add functionality for dealer filter checkboxes
- [X] Fix phone icon in dealer cards, same issue as the modals
- [ ] Fix When menu issue when opening menu/dealer filter in mobile the menu disappears from the desktop view.
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Review for redundancy
